* Update on Workstream 5 Proposal: AI Assisted Development Security  
* Potential donation of Cisco's Project CodeGuard to CoSAI  
* Announcement of upcoming ballot on budget for the RSAC booth  
* Proposal to open a short survey to find out which resources CoSAI members and contributors rely on for guidance and latest research

## Summary

* **Governance Ballot Updates:** David inquired about the voting progress for the governance ballot, noting that only 9 out of the required 16 votes had been cast. He emphasized the difficulty in securing votes despite efforts from himself, Omar, Claudia, and Ingrid, particularly as the ballot aimed to simplify governance rules. David encouraged committee members to reach out to their contacts within the PGB to encourage voting.

* **Policy Workshop Opportunity at NVIDIA GTC:** David and Omar agreed on tabling the discussion on the policy workshop to include Daniel. Omar highlighted that while many people would be at the conference, the west coast location might be inconvenient for policy experts mostly on the east coast, making Daniel's presence important for the discussion.

* **Focus on Tools vs. White Papers:** David initiated a discussion on whether CoSAI should focus on developing and supporting tools, using Google's recently open-sourced policy manager as an example. He expressed the desire for more tangible outputs for users beyond just white papers, and mentioned that Omar had another tool proposal, Cisco's Project CodeGuard \[an open-source framework designed to embed security rules directly into the workflow of AI coding tools\] that might go to OWASP if CoSAI didn't pick it up. David noted that discussions about tools and speed for users had been ongoing for months without decisive action.

* **Proposal for AI Assisted Development Security Workstream:** Omar clarified that their proposal was not just about a specific tool but about establishing a new workstream, Workstream 5: AI Assisted Development Security. He explained that Cisco had been successfully developing and applying distilled best practices for AI-assisted development, particularly for security, during various stages of agent development, including threat modeling and design sessions. Omar proposed donating these best practices to CoSAI if the workstream was created, emphasizing the need for a decision within two weeks due to the rapid pace of developments. 

* Matt expressed that the industry desires prescriptive solutions, frameworks, and concrete answers, not just thought leadership or white papers. He suggested working backward from industry needs to identify what is most clamored for, whether it involves backing existing solutions or innovating new ones. J.R.echoed this, stating that the value in the industry is shifting away from long white papers toward more prescriptive tools and conversations, and that CoSAI should help its customer base through tangible outputs. Jason suggested a control framework for AI systems, similar to insider threat frameworks, that isn't duplicative of existing efforts by OWASP or CSA. 

* Daniel questioned the need for an entirely new workstream for AI-assisted coding, suggesting it could be a special interest group under the existing agentic workstream to avoid increased communication load and fragmentation. He emphasized focusing on concrete use cases within existing structures rather than creating more workstreams.

* **Consensus on AI-Assisted Coding Priority:** J.R. confirmed that AI-assisted coding was ranked highly by the TSC as a priority. He stated that the primary goal was to agree on the content and scope of such an effort before deciding on its organizational structure, whether as a new workstream or within an existing one. Omar reiterated that the decision was whether to create a new workstream, and if so, whether a donation like CodeGuard should be one of its first items.

* **Rethinking the "Agentic" Workstream:** Jason suggested that the existing "agentic" workstream should pick a different, more specific area and be renamed. He argued that "agentic" had lost its meaning, and that both workstreams should aim for specific, recommended products and focus on "control maps" rather than white papers. Josiah supported this view, highlighting the risk of diluting efforts and increasing communication overhead with more workstreams.

* **Call for Actionable Deliverables:** David expressed frustration that despite repeated statements about not wanting white papers, the group had not moved closer to defining what tangible deliverables they did want. Jason proposed that CoSAI's goal should be to create "control maps," which he later clarified as "control lists," as these are measurable and directly useful to the industry, potentially with AI assistance. He suggested these would largely be new controls, with only a small overlap with existing standards like NIST or ISO.

* Daniel agreed with the need for control lists but emphasized the importance of tying them to operationalization and evidence generation, suggesting the need for a comprehensive approach that bridges governance with engineering. Jason then proposed a three-stage lifecycle for every workstream: writing opinion/strategic pieces, translating those into control lists, and then developing actionable, working code or practical applications from those lists. David supported this as a "flywheel" for CoSAI's output.

* David outlined the objective to enable users and agents to secure their assets more quickly with low cost and cognitive friction. They emphasized the need to quickly produce required guidance and map it to understandable controls, ideally providing a materialized version in open-source tooling where possible.

* **Mission and Story Refinement:** David highlighted a recrystallization of the mission, focusing on the necessity of the flywheel existing for real advancement from year one to year two. He proposed a new standard: everything in guidance must have a control map, and there should always be at least one materialized example of a control that can be tested or implemented.

* **Upcoming Budget Vote for RSA Booth:** Omar and David briefly discussed the upcoming budget vote for the RSA booth. David questioned the value of the booth as a spending priority and suggested a need for a broader discussion within the PGB about the most effective ways to engage as a group, possibly reallocating funds to things like mixers, panels, or contracting for routine work  or coding that cannot be automated.

* **Proposed Short Survey on Member/User Resources:** David also introduced a proposal for a short, cost-free survey aimed at understanding what resources organizations are currently using to define controls and build tools. The survey would explore people's reliance on major standards bodies, open-source groups, and research to understand where users are deriving their control definitions, helping CoSAI to better map its efforts to user needs.

## Next Steps and Actions

* The group will add the governance workshop opportunity with the NVIDIA GTC to the next PGB or ExSC agenda to Daniel Rohrer in the discussion.  
* David and Omar will pair up to write up the re-cristallization of the mission and story to include the flywheel which requires everything in guidance to become a control map and a materialized example.
