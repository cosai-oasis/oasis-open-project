# CoSAI Open Project Governance 

_This document was approved by the CoSAI PGB, 22 July 2024. Updates were approved by the PGB on 29 July 2024_

This document defines the Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI) Open Project governance. This document changes infrequently by the process defined below.

## Overview
The Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI) unites diverse stakeholders to tackle critical challenges inherent to building and deploying secure AI systems. Through collaborative AI security research and product development, best practice sharing, and joint initiatives, the Coalition for Secure AI aims to enhance threat mitigation strategies and drive security advancements that can be shared across the AI ecosystem to build societal trust in secure AI systems. 

## Code of Conduct and General Rules of Collaboration
CoSAI, an OASIS Open Project, is committed to building an open, inclusive, productive and self-governing open source community. This community is governed by this document and in accordance with the [OASIS Open Project Rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/). The purpose of this document is to define how the CoSAI community should work together to achieve their goals.

The PGB follows and is responsible for upholding the [OASIS Open Project Rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/), and any [Standing Rules](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/STANDING-RULES.md) it adopts.

​The CoSAI Open Project follows the [OASIS Participants Code of Conduct](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/). The Project will operate in a collaborative and transparent manner. 

The CoSAI Open Project maintains a no-solicitation policy covering all meetings, webinars, and other events. Additionally, it is expected that participation in this Open Project will not result in future solicitations unless specifically invited. 

Any violations to the Code of Conduct or rules of collaboration can be brought to the [Open Project Administrator](mailto:op-admin@oasis-open.org).

## Code Repositories
This document applies to all code repositories under the CoSAI github organization that resides at [https://github.com/cosai-oasis](https://github.com/cosai-oasis).

## Project Leadership and Community Roles

### Project Governing Board
The Project Governing Board (PGB) is the group responsible for the overall lifecycle or business strategy of the project and for the approval of official work products. The PGB also oversees activities such as events, marketing, partnerships, promotion, budget, and so forth. The PGB also follows and is responsible for upholding the [OASIS Open Projects Rules](https://github.com/cosai-oasis), and any Standing Rules it adopts.

#### Composition
Each Sponsoring organization has the option to have one voting representative on the PGB. One PGB seat is also reserved for a representative from the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). 

All PGB members' participation is governed by [OASIS Open Project Rules section 15.3](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/#repository-specification-licenses-special-covenant).

Non-voting guests are permitted at PGB meetings by invitation of a PGB chair.

The PGB must at all times have a **Chair or two co-Chairs**. Only members of the PGB are eligible to be Chair or co-Chair. For the remainder of this section, Chair shall mean either the single Chair or each of the two co-Chairs, whichever the group has.

The Chair is elected or re-confirmed every two years by a [Full Majority Vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dFullMajority) of the PGB. If the PGB does not have a Chair, then all activities, with the exception of the selection of a new Chair, are suspended. Existing Chairs serve until they resign or are replaced in an election. The PGB may also remove a Chair at any time with a [Full Majority Vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dFullMajority).

Chair responsibilities include providing leadership, acting as primary liaison to OASIS staff and in general ensuring that the PGB works efficiently to achieve its goals. The Chair is responsible for preparing the agenda for the PGB meetings, facilitating the meetings, and making sure minutes are recorded and published. Further description of the chair role and responsibilities can be found in the [OASIS Open Project Rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/#chairs-maintainers-technical-steering-committees-opChairs).

The PGB can also appoint one or two board coordinators to support the Chairs by [lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html).

The PGB roster is maintained [here](https://www.coalitionforsecureai.org/leadership/).

#### Decisions
For most decisions, the PGB operates by [lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html). In addition to the votes required by [OASIS Open Project Rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process), a [full majority vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dFullMajority) of the PGB is required for decisions including (but not limited to):

* Any action or decision that may bind the CoSAI project to commitments or obligations with any external party or entity, including but not limited to legal, financial, or intellectual property related commitments or obligations
* Election of PGB Chairs/Co-Chairs
* Starting a new workstream into CoSAI
* Endorsements, partnerships, or liaisons with other groups
* Substantive changes to the Governance policies or documents

Promoting work to stages in the OASIS standards track (Project Specification Draft, Project Specification, or submission as candidate for OASIS Standard) requires a [Special Majority Vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dSpecialMajority) run by OASIS staff. Please see the [Open Project Rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/#progression-of-project-work) for promoting work through its various stages.

### Technical Steering Committee (TSC) 
The TSC is responsible for the overall technical health and direction of the project and advises the PGB on such matters. Further, the TSC is responsible for releases, and overseeing work of Workstreams, WS Chairs, Contributors, and Maintainers.

[Premier Sponsors and Founding Sponsors](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/SPONSORS.md) will have the option for one TSC Representative. This person may be different from the PGB representative and should be a subject matter expert.

The PGB also creates a set number of TSC seats for non-sponsoring participants which are held for academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and other non-commercial entities such as government organizations. These members should also participate in at least one Workstream.

**The TSC will be populated by the following process:**
* TSC members representing sponsoring members are selected by that sponsoring member as they know their talent the best. This person can be switched out with prior notice to the PGB and OASIS staff. 
* Appointment for the non-sponsor seats is done by a consensus vote by the PGB up the number of seats previously set by the PGB.

The PGB can adjust the process for populating the TSC once the membership number normalizes and will review this rule on TSC membership eligibility, including non-sponsor seats, on an annual basis.

The PGB can also reappoint or re-confirm the non-sponsor seats on an annual basis.

#### TSC Chairs, PGB rep, and Maintainers
The TSC has **two Co-Chairs** elected by the TSC with a [Full Majority Vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dFullMajority). The Chairs of a TSC are responsible for preparing an agenda for each meeting, organizing and facilitating the meetings, making sure minutes are taken and published, and working with OASIS staff to schedule ballots. The Chairs should have a firm understanding of the technology under the TSC's purview.

The TSC has to select **one member to represent it on the PGB**. This representative’s organization shall not already be represented on the PGB to avoid any one organization having two votes on the PGB.

The TSC will also need to appoint at least one **Maintainer** who will serve as principal editor of the Project’s technical work managed within its Project Repositories. If the TSC fails to appoint a maintainer, the PGB shall appoint one.

The TSC is also tasked with creating a **Maintainer policy** and a **Contributing policy**. The latter defines what type of contributions are accepted, how they are reviewed and what the general contribution process looks like.

#### Responsibilities of TSC members
All TSC members are expected to attend the committee meetings on a regular basis and contribute to the objectives and outcomes of those meetings. Every TSC member is required to be involved in at least one work stream.

#### Recall Procedure
Any community member may submit a request for recall of a TSC chair to the PGB at any time by submitting the request and sufficient justification to the PGB chair or co-chairs. Such requests shall be held in confidence by the PGB chair or co-chairs. In the event of receipt of such a request, the chair or co-chairs shall schedule the recall as an item for discussion at the next PGB meeting, which shall be held no later than 30 days after the receipt of the request. After subsequent discussion, the recall shall be decided upon by a [Full Majority Vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dFullMajority) of the PGB. In the event of a recall vote passing, the TSC chair shall at that time be considered immediately recalled and be relieved of all responsibilities conferred via the position. If needed, a new TSC Chair or Co-Chair shall be appointed by the PGB.

### Workstreams
Workstreams (WS) are defined by the PGB. Topic, scope, milestones, and deliverables for each WS are also defined by the PGB. See [this file](./WORKSTREAMS.md) for the initial workstreams and deliverables.

Workstream contributors can also propose amendments to the scope and deliverables for their workstream to the TSC. This feedback may be communicated by the Workstream Chair.

Workstreams (WS) can occur concurrently or consecutively as decided by the PGB based on resources and timeline planning.

Each WS is chaired by a member of the TSC, and all non-sponsor seats are expected to participate in at least one WS. 

Contributors can be assigned to a WS by the PGB. The PGB can also delegate this task to the TSC.

When a WS completes a work product that it wants approved, the WS team sends the work product to the TSC for a vote, and then the TSC can send it to the PGB for final approval consistent with the OASIS rules.

### Optional Committees
In addition to the TSC, the PGB may form other groups as they deem necessary, such as a Marketing Group, Advisory Council (experts who may be advocates for the project without being deeply involved), or an Executive Steering Committee in the event the PGB grows too large.

The PGB may form these groups by lazy consensus and shall appoint a Committee Chair or Co-Chairs. The process to populate the committee will also be established at the time of commencement. Ideally, these groups are populated by appointment or are self-selecting.

Members of these committees are Contributors to the CoSAI project and thus are required to sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/cla/entity-cla-20210630/) and need to conform with this Governance and the [OASIS Participants Code of Conduct](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-participants-code-of-conduct/).

These committees should report back to the PGB on a regular basis. 

### Other Community Roles
The CoSAI Open Project is an Open Source project and anyone can join as a contributor, whether they are employed by a sponsor organization or not. Contributors do not have to be a member of the PGB or the TSC.

**Contributors:** A Contributor is someone who has agreed to the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and who makes regular contributions to one or more CoSAI workstreams and repositories (including but not limited to activities such as documentation, code reviews, responding to issues, participation in proposal discussions, contributing code, etc.). Any person (whether or not an OASIS member or CoSAI sponsor) may participate in CoSAI as a Contributor. The role of contributor is furthermore defined in the [OASIS Open Project Rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/).

**Maintainers:** A Maintainer is someone who has agreed to the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and has been selected by the TSC to oversee one or more components of a CoSAI repositories to review code and pull requests, prepare releases, triage issues, and similar tasks. Maintainers and their requisite duties are managed by the TSC. Any person (whether or not an OASIS member or CoSAI sponsor) may be appointed as a project Maintainer. The role of Maintainer is furthermore defined in the OASIS Open Project Rules.

## Required Legal Agreements
Contributors to any CoSAI project must abide by the [OASIS Open Projects IPR Policy](https://github.com/oasis-open-projects/documentation/blob/master/policy/clas-and-special-covenant.md) and Apache 2.0 License agreement as well as the CC-BY 4.0 license agreement as outlined in the license.md files.

All contributors are required to make these rights available by signing a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/cla/entity-cla-20210630/) and patent non-assert for non-trivial contributions releasing contributions under the Apache License v2.0 for source code and models and CC-BY 4.0 for documentation and data contributions. If you have questions about these policies, please contact the [OASIS Open Project Administrator](mailto:op-admin@oasis-open.org).

All participants must also abide by the terms of the [OASIS Participants Code of Conduct](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-participants-code-of-conduct/).

## Updating Governance
All substantive changes in Governance require a [Full Majority Vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dFullMajority) of the PGB.

## Approved Committees

### Executive Steering Committee (approved by the PGB on 29 July)
The Executive Steering Committee shall be composed of Premier sponsors and Founding Members of the CoSAI PGB. This structure will be re-evaluated after one year. The Chair(s) of the Executive Steering Committee will be the same as the Chairs of the PGB. 

[Founding Members](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/SPONSORS.md) are considered as organizations who signed the membership agreement prior to the official project launch on July 18, 2024. 

Duties of this Committee could include but are not limited to drafting PGB meeting agendas, draft strategy and communications plans for the entire PGB's feedback, coordinating the use of supplemental services for Premier Sponsor allocations, and more. The Executive Steering Committee will act in the best interest of the entire PGB and Open Project.

### Public Sector Committee (approved by the PGB on 24 September 2024) 
The PSC is a subcommittee of the PGB. Any PGB member or their alternate can join this committee, but no organization can have more than one vote.

The purpose of the Public Sector Committee (PSC) is to define and document how CoSAI members and contributors engage and interact with in-scope standards bodies, civil society entities, and non-legislative government entities.
The committee is responsible for developing and proposing the overall public sector engagement strategy and implementation. See [Public Sector Committee Governance](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/PUBLIC-SECTOR-COMMITTEE-GOVERNANCE.md) for more details.
